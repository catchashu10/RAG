      "['Isn’t it awful? You would swear that there wasn’t enough hot water to go around!\\n', 'A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.\\n When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an IP address. This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own.\\n How a Proxy Works\\nBecause a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge\\n Benefits of a Proxy Server\\n Enhanced security: Can act like a firewall between your systems and the internet. Without them, hackers have easy access to your IP address, which they can use to infiltrate your computer or network.\\n Private browsing, watching, listening, and shopping: Use different proxies to help you avoid getting inundated with unwanted ads or the collection of IP-specific data.\\n Access to location-specific content: You can designate a proxy server with an address associated with another country. You can, in effect, make it look like you are in that country and gain full access to all the content computers in that country are allowed to interact with.\\n', \"MacArthur's Park\\n\", \"Don't let apps that are liers put adds on your site. Like ones that say they have free age verification, but try charging your card. There all fucking liers, just dont understand why sites promote them and let them post there lies on your site. Also if you want your site to be better, when I click on mature anal lover's. It does not go to that it goes to a lying BS hook up site, that charges you for age verification. Like mature women just a bummer I can't get to the site. Big waist of my time really. Sure your making money from the bastards, if not making money from them.

It assumes an intermediary role, receiving requests and transmitting them with its own IP address to another network. Proxy servers can be used on the Internet to hide the IP address. The basic meaning of the word '' 'proxy' '' is “the agency, function, or trade of someone acting as a substitute for another” (Merriam Webster English Dictionary).\n",
      " So the main objective of a proxy is to act as a substitute. In principle, anyone can configure their own proxy server.\n",
      "Network proxy: A proxy server can also be used as part of a network, which is known as a network proxy or network proxy. Two communication partners can exchange files or requests without transmitting the actual network address.\n",
      " Dedicated proxy: A dedicated proxy, or dedicated proxy, not only connects two communication partners but also has a direct effect on the way of communication. You can manipulate, filter, or cache the data packets that are sent to you. Caching is widely applied, especially on the Internet. In this way, the requested files are available more quickly to the Internet user.\n",
      " Circuit level proxy: A circuit-level proxy, or circuit-level proxy, is typically installed on a firewall. It works independently of the network protocol as a filter for traffic from specific addresses or ports.\n",
      " There are a lot of proxy providers. [LINKED_TEXT: Global Peer to Business Proxy Network] [URL: https://infatica.io/] is one of them. To know more click [LINKED_TEXT: here] [URL: https://infatica.io/].\n",

      "A proxy server receives requests for information from a particular URL and passes the request to another server. Then it forwards the answer to the computer that asked the question. Think of this analogy. A receptionist at a dentist's office receives a call from a patient asking if she can continue taking Tylenol. He asks the dentist, who answers the question. The receptionist then transmits the answer to the caller. The receptionist is the agent. Within an organisation, such as a university or business, proxy servers can cope with the Internet (outward) and transmit requests from computers on the campus network to destination computers outside the network. Or they can look inside, receive requests for information, and send them to computers located on campus or in the business network. Hackers can access your proxy server, but not the server that actually runs the web software.\n",
      " Nowadays there plenty of great proxy server providers like ProxyAqua, Smartproxy, and Netnut, and many others that offer you a great variety of proxy services that can be useful for you while working as well as while browsing the web for your own purposes.\n",

      "Answer: A proxy server is a computer that acts as an intermediary between your computer and the Internet. When you access the Internet, your computer will first connect to the proxy server, which will then connect to the website you want to access. The proxy server will then send the website information back to your computer.\n",
      "Proxy servers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as to improve security or to filter content. When used for security, a proxy server can help to protect your computer from malware or hackers. By filtering content, a proxy server can block websites that contain offensive or illegal content.\n",
      " There are a few different types of proxy servers, including web proxies, application proxies, and SOCKS proxies. Web proxies are the most common type of proxy server. They can be used to access websites that are blocked by your ISP or firewall. Application proxies can be used to access specific applications that are blocked. SOCKS proxies can be used to access any type of Internet traffic, including email, chat, and file sharing.\n",
      " Proxy servers can be configured in a number of ways. They can be configured to allow or deny access to specific websites or IP addresses. They can also be configured to use different ports for different types of traffic.\n",
